## 🌟 **Top Features of Node.js**

### 1. 🔁 **Asynchronous and Non-blocking I/O**

* It doesn't wait for operations like file or database access to complete — it moves on and handles the result via **callbacks**, **Promises**, or **async/await**.

---

### 2. ⚙️ **Single-threaded but Highly Scalable**

* Uses a **single-threaded event loop** to handle multiple clients concurrently.
* Behind the scenes, it uses **libuv** and a **thread pool** for background I/O operations.

### 3. 🚀 **Very Fast**

* Built on **Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine**.
* Compiles JavaScript to native machine code for high-speed execution.

---
