| Feature              | Description                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🖱️ DOM Manipulation | Modify HTML elements, CSS styles, and page content dynamically           |
| 📦 Form Validation   | Check user input before submitting (e.g., required fields, email format) |
| 🧠 Event Handling    | Respond to user actions like clicks, scrolls, typing                     |
| 🎨 UI Effects        | Create animations, sliders, modals, tooltips                             |
| 🔄 AJAX/Fetch API    | Send/receive data from server **without reloading** the page             |
| 📍 Browser Control   | Access browser history, cookies, localStorage                            |
| 📅 Real-Time Updates | Show real-time clocks, countdowns, auto-refresh content                  |

## 🔁 Example: DOM & Event Handling

```html
<button onclick="changeText()">Click Me</button>
<p id="demo">Hello!</p>

<script>
  function changeText() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerText = "Text Changed!";
  }
</script>
```

🟢 When you click the button, the paragraph text changes.

## 📦 Technologies Involved

* **HTML + CSS** = Structure + Style
* **JavaScript** = Logic + Interactivity
* Runs in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

---

## 🔐 Limitations of Client-Side JavaScript

* Can't access server/database directly
* Can't read/write local files (for security)
* Can be **disabled** by users in browsers
* Code is **visible** to users (not secure for sensitive logic)

---

### ✅ Best Use Cases

* Form validation
* Dynamic content updates
* UI animations and transitions
* Real-time user interface (with APIs or WebSockets)
