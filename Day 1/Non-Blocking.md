## 🔄 What is Non-blocking I/O in Node.js?

**Non-blocking I/O** means **input/output operations (like reading files, querying a database, or making API calls) don't stop the execution of your code.** Instead of waiting for a task to complete, Node.js continues running the rest of the code and handles the result later when it's ready.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Simplified):

Node.js uses an **event-driven architecture** and an **event loop** that continuously listens for tasks/events and handles them asynchronously using **callbacks**, **Promises**, or **async/await**.

---

### 🧠 Traditional (Blocking) vs Node.js (Non-blocking):

**🔴 Blocking I/O (Traditional)**

```js
const fs = require('fs');

const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt'); // ❌ Blocking: waits for file to load
console.log(data.toString());
console.log("This line waits");
```

> ❗Here, the program halts until `file.txt` is completely read.

---

**🟢 Non-blocking I/O (Node.js style)**

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data.toString());
});

console.log("This line runs immediately");
```

> ✅ The program keeps running. File reading happens in the background, and once done, the callback function is executed.

---

## 📊 Why Non-blocking is Great for Scalability?

Node.js handles **thousands of connections** with just **one thread** using non-blocking I/O. For each request:

* It **does not create a new thread**.
* It delegates I/O tasks to the **system (like OS-level threads)**.
* When the task finishes, Node.js **receives a signal (event)** and runs the callback.

## 🧠 Real-World Example: Chat App

In a chat app:

* User A sends a message (this triggers an API call to the server).
* Server writes it to a database.
* Server simultaneously sends it to User B.

🟢 With Non-blocking I/O:

* Node.js doesn’t wait for the database write to complete.
* It **instantly handles** other incoming messages and connections.

---

## 🔄 Event Loop Summary (Visual Steps)

```text
1. Program starts → Sends I/O task to system (like file read or DB call)
2. Continues executing other JS code
3. When I/O task completes → Sends event to Event Loop
4. Event Loop triggers callback/Promise handler
```

---

## ✅ Benefits

* High performance under heavy load
* Efficient memory and CPU usage
* Suitable for **real-time**, **data-intensive**, or **high-concurrency** apps
