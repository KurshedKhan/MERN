### âš¡ What is **Event-Driven** in Node.js?

**Event-driven** means that the flow of the program is determined by **events** (like user actions, HTTP requests, I/O completions), and **callbacks** or **handlers** are triggered in response.

---

### ðŸ”„ How It Works:

Node.js uses an **event loop** and an **event emitter** system to listen for events and execute the corresponding callback functions when those events occur.

---

### ðŸ§  Think of it like:

> A waiter in a restaurant: instead of standing still until a dish is ready, the waiter keeps taking new orders and serves dishes **only when notified (event)** that they're ready.

---

### ðŸ§ª Example: EventEmitter in Node.js

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Listener (runs when 'greet' event is emitted)
emitter.on('greet', () => {
  console.log('Hello! Event has been triggered.');
});

// Emitting an event
emitter.emit('greet');
```

ðŸŸ¢ Output:

```
Hello! Event has been triggered.
```

### ðŸ“¦ Real-Life Examples in Node.js

| Event       | Triggered When...                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `'request'` | HTTP server gets a new request             |
| `'data'`    | Stream receives new chunk of data          |
| `'end'`     | Data stream ends                           |
| `'error'`   | An error occurs in I/O or async operations |
| `'close'`   | File, socket, or stream is closed          |

---

### âœ… Advantages of Event-Driven Model:

* Efficient handling of **concurrent requests**
* Reduces **thread overhead**
* Great for **real-time** and **I/O-heavy** applications
